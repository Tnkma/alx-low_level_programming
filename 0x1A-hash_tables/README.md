        HASH TABLES

Hash table is a data structure used in storing pairs of information as key and values
In this project, we are going to feature :-

Hash function used to get the index of a key. This index is used in storing the value
insert function used in inserting values
a search function for searching and retriving values
A delete function that deletes a value from the hash tables

This project is to demostrate the skill of creating a function that gets the index from the ASCII of the value and store the value, search and retrive the value and be able to delete a value from the table.
